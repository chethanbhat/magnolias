There is more than one great movie with ‘magnolia’ in the title as well; Magnolia (1999), directed, written and produced by Paul Thomas Anderson. It’s an “epic” film, –not used in the slang sense, so much as the incredibly long, and full of characters, sense. The film is a bit like Crash (2004), in that it deals with several characters, all interrelated in little ways, all experiencing their own private, tragic and comedic existences. Anderson ties them together with details, and has an amazing all-star cast to keep the audience riveted. Cast members include Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, and John C. Reilly.
